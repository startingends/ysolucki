# Notebook: running brainstorm

Dated, informal, newest at the bottom. Anything goes here: half-thoughts, analogies, dead ends, questions.
When a note becomes testable it gets a number in `docs/IDEAS.md` and the note says so.

**N1. Start from the duality, not from the zeros.** (lead) Before any clever idea: rebuild primes from zeros
and zeros from primes ourselves. Done (U-1). Thirty-five prime powers already locate five zeros to 2 digits.
Thought: the "primes → zeros" sum is a spectrometer. RH is a statement about the *width* of its spectral
lines as more primes are added. Is there a sharp statement? → Q1.

**N2. One rule behind every "all zeros real" result.** (lead) PROVED (classical). Let A(s) = Σ_{n≤N} c_n n^(−s),
c_n real, zero-free in Re s > 1/2. Put E(z) = e^(iωz) A(1/2 + iz), E*(z) = e^(−iωz) A(1/2 − iz), so
f = E + E* on the real axis. R = E/E* is analytic in the upper half-plane (A(1/2 − iz) has real part of its
argument > 1/2 there), |R| = 1 on the real axis, and |R| is bounded as Im z → ∞ when ω ≥ ½ log N. By
Phragmén–Lindelöf |R| < 1 in the open upper half-plane, so f = E*(1 + R) ≠ 0 there; the lower half-plane is
symmetric. Hence all zeros of f are real. ∎
Everything else is a variation: Pólya's fake zeta functions, Taylor/Lagarias ξ(s+a) ± ξ(s−a), Gonek's
symmetrised Euler products, de Branges spaces.

**N3. Lee–Yang in Bohr's variables.** (lead) Replace p^(−it) by an independent variable x_p on the unit
circle (Bohr). "A is zero-free in Re s > 1/2" becomes "the polynomial Σ c_n n^(−1/2) x^(v(n)) has no zero in
the open unit polydisc", which is exactly the Lee–Yang property physicists use to pin partition-function
zeros to a circle. Hand check: sharp cut at 2 is Lee–Yang (zero at |x₂| = √2 > 1); sharp cut at 3 is not
(1 + x₂/√2 + x₃/√3 vanishes at x₂ = x₃ = −0.78). COMPUTED: matches the zero counts in U-3 exactly.
Move borrowed: Lee–Yang (a qualitative property of the system pins the zeros). → idea #6.

**N4. Why the product wins.** (lead) In Bohr's variables the Euler product is a product of one-variable
factors (1 − x_p/√p), each harmless alone, and *independent*. A sum over integers mixes the variables through
the ordering n ≤ N, which is additive information. So the two structures of B10 show up as: multiplication =
independence of the variables x_p; addition = the cut-off and the Gamma factor that couples them. RH needs a
coupling that does not destroy the Lee–Yang property. WILD: is the Gamma factor the *unique* coupling that
preserves it? → Q3, Q4.

**N5. One prime at a time.** (lead) WILD. Lee and Yang's theorem is proved by building the system bond by
bond (Asano contraction), each step preserving the property. Here: is there an operation "adjoin the prime p"
on symmetric functions, preserving real zeros, whose infinite composition is ξ? Each step would have to be
compensated by a change in the archimedean part (window, Gamma factor), since adding a prime alone lowers the
Weil form. → idea #7.

**N6. Blind tests.** (lead) Li's criterion sees a zero at height γ only at index ~γ² (idea #1). Suspect the
same blindness in every positivity test. Make it a rule: for each criterion, compute its "detection index"
on the impostor before using it for anything.

**N7. Memory accident.** (lead) An outer product of 78 734 × 12 500 doubles (8 GB) was killed by the kernel;
rerun in chunks under `tools/memcap.py 3`. Rule: every numpy job in this repo runs under memcap.

**N8. The owner's six rules, applied to my own ideas.** (lead) #6 (Lee-Yang lift) is exactly what rule 1
rejects: another look-alike family. Parked. The understanding it gave stays (U-3). Lesson: I was working
from the toolbox.

**N9. Working backwards (rule 3).** (lead) Details in `rh/KEY_LEMMA_SHAPE.md`. The two observations I did
not have this morning: (a) S1: nothing linear in the function can work, because the impostor lives in the
same 2-dimensional space as two honest L-functions; (b) S3: zero margin is fatal for estimates but harmless
for an equality-case argument, where zero margin is the *hypothesis*.

**N10. First failed attempt on #8, and why (wall W2).** (lead) At a first-failure window the null vector
gives a zero-side sum vanishing on an interval. Hoped: analytic continuation forces all coefficients to
vanish, then a counting argument (an entire function of exponential type a0 cannot vanish at all zeros,
whose density grows like log T) gives a contradiction. Fails: with infinitely dense frequencies the
exponentials are over-complete on any finite interval, so vanishing on an interval says nothing coefficient
by coefficient. I told myself "I can do it" and looked again: the density that kills uniqueness on the zero
side is the same density that makes the *prime* side finite on the window. So the contradiction must be
sought on the prime side, where the equation has finitely many terms. That is the next thing to try.

**N11. A number that separates true from false.** (lead) a0 = first-failure half-width. Finite for the
impostor (blind prediction 2.8 +- 0.5 on record in idea #8), infinite for zeta iff RH. WILD: is 1/a0 a
natural "distance from RH" for a general Dirichlet series, continuous in the coefficients? If so, the honest
L-functions sit at 1/a0 = 0, the boundary of the range. That would be the picture asked for in Q5: zero
slack because true L-functions are extreme points.

**N12. My first blind prediction missed, and that taught more than a hit would have.** (lead) Predicted
a0 = 2.8 for the impostor; lane A measured 1.71. My mental picture had a loud positive background that an
off-line zero must overcome. The truth is the opposite: the windowed form is almost exactly degenerate
(eigenvalues like 1e-30), a whisper is enough, and only the *height* of the bad zero matters, not how far
off the line it is. New picture: the window of half-width a is a telescope that resolves heights up to
about 4 pi e^(2a)/q, and it reports a violation the instant one comes into view.

**N13. What this does to the template (#8).** (lead) HEURISTIC. At a first-failure window for zeta itself the
null vector would be a wave packet at the height T of the first bad zero, and the equation says its envelope
h is reproduced by prime-shifted copies with phases n^(-iT), n up to about T/(4 pi), with total strength
log(T/2 pi). The available total weight is sum Lambda(n)/sqrt(n) ~ 2 sqrt(T/4 pi), vastly more than log T,
so a size argument cannot forbid it: only a statement about *phases of primes at frequency T* can.
So the key lemma is a statement that the primes up to X cannot be coherent at a frequency T ~ 4 pi X in a
specific self-reproducing way. Note the regime: frequency about 4 pi times the length. That is exactly where
the functional equation balances (the two halves of the approximate functional equation have equal length).
WILD: the null-vector equation is a fixed-point equation for a "prime-shift transfer operator at frequency
T"; RH would say this operator never has eigenvalue exactly log(T/2 pi) on the window. Compare its spectrum
for the impostor at T = 85.7 and for zeta at the same T.
